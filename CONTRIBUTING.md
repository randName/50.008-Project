# Contributing guidelines

### Contributing code

If you have improvements to NeuralTest, send us your pull requests! For those
just getting started, Github has a [howto](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

Every major open-source project has its own style guide: a set of conventions (sometimes arbitrary)
about how to write code for that project. It is much easier to understand a large codebase when all
the code in it is in a consistent style. The style guide use for this project is [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
